config CPU_FREQ_GOV_SMARTASS2
	tristate "'smartassV2' cpufreq governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
	help
	SmartassV2 is a governor (controls the frequency of the 
	CPU at each give moment) which like the first smartass is 
	generally based on the implementation of interactive with
	some major changes and the addition of a built in sleep
	profile (behaves a bit differently when screen is off vs. on).
	The smartassV2 improves the very naive scheme which the first
	smartass had

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_WHEATLEY
	tristate "'wheatley' cpufreq governor"
	depends on CPU_FREQ
     ---help---
	Building on the classic 'ondemand' governor is implemented Wheatley
	governor. The governor has two additional parameters that control
	the state.

config CPU_FREQ_GOV_LAGFREE
        tristate "'lagfree' cpufreq governor"
        depends on CPU_FREQ
        ---help---
	Lagfree is similar to ondemand. Main difference is it's optimization
	to become more battery friendly. Frequency is gracefully decreased and
	increased, unlike ondemand which jumps to 100% too often. Lagfree does
	not skip any frequency step while scaling up or down. Remember that if
	there's a requirement for sudden burst of power, lagfree can not satisfy
	that since it has to raise cpu through each higher frequency step from
	current. Some users report that video playback using lagfree stutters a little.
